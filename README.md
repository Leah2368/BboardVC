# Microbit BLE LED Matrix Demo

Control the LED Matrix on your Microbit using Web BLE

After pairing with your Microbit, you can click on the checkboxes to turn LEDs on and off, or you can enter in text to scroll on the display.

FIRST install [this default firmware](https://cdn.glitch.com/6fa6cef2-3e6a-4764-9efc-10452b84af4d%2FBBC_MICROBIT_OOB_FINAL.hex?1550077977282) onto your Microbit (by download the .hex file, connecting your Microbit to your computer via USB, and dragging the hex file onto the mounted drive).
